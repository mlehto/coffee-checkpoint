# coffee-checkpoint
Touch &amp; drink checkpoint for logging office coffee consumption. Tiny unit with OLED display for recent log entries, ESP module for web communication and NFC reader for checkins.

Built for logging coffee consumpition in our agile team. Whenever you have a cup, you just slam your ID card on the reader, it logs it to web database and shows your consumption since last billing. The guys get billed monthly based on coffee consumption and new PODs are bought in with the money. Simple and fast.

The unit itself is built on Arduino Nano, housed in a 3D printed case together with NFC reader and ESP8266.
